            <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
            <p>1. Position button, sometimes there are marks indicating where it was</p>
            <p>2. Thread the needle and tie a knot at the end. The length of your thread should be 1.5 times the size
               of your wrist. 
            </p>
            <p>3. Start from the inside of the garment hiding the knot on the inside.</p>
            <p>4. Bring the needle through one of the buttonholes, then down through the opposite hole. Repeat this a
               few times between the two buttonholes making sure itâ€™s tight and secure.
            </p>
            <p>5. If the button is meant to sit above the fabric (like on a coat), you might want to create a shank. To
               do this, after sewing the button on securely, but before finishing off the thread, place a toothpick
               or a matchstick horizontally on top of the button. Wrap the thread around the toothpick a few times,
               then sew through the fabric underneath to secure the shank. Remove the toothpick and finish off the
               thread.
            </p>
            <p>6. Once the button is securely attached, finish off the thread by making a few small stitches underneath
               the button. Tie a knot close to the fabric and trim any excess thread.
            </p>
            <p>7. Make sure the button is secure by gently tugging on it.</p>
            <p>8. You can use a bit of fabric glue / super glue / clear nail polish on the knot to ensure the button
               does not fall off again.
